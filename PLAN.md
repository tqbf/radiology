# Radiology documentation index and current state

Radiology is a native, read-only macOS repository browser. The active implementation is the root SwiftPM package, now tracked in Git on `main` for [tqbf/radiology](https://github.com/tqbf/radiology). A local nested `repo/` directory is an inherited, inactive starter copy, excluded from version control: do not edit it. The user explicitly authorized initializing Git and publishing the project after the documentation handoff. AGENTS.md normally prohibits agent merges; on 2026-10-11 the user explicitly authorized merging the accumulated reader-work publication to `main`.

## Current accepted state

**Published to GitHub main (2026-10-11):** all accumulated work merged through
[PR #1](https://github.com/tqbf/radiology/pull/1), explicitly authorized by the
user after initially requesting a push. Feature commit `3b8f7f5`, merge `dfc877a`
at **14:53:25 CDT**; local main fast-forwarded to the confirmed GitHub merge.
The preceding 269-test/signed-build gates cover this snapshot. Publication docs
supersede earlier rounds' local/uncommitted statements.
[Scope, commits and validation](plans/github-publication.md).

**Repository/PR bookmarks (2026-10-11):** third independently scrolling,
resizable Context pane; ⌘D toggles the exact caret, ⌘0–⌘9 use the first ten
ordered bookmarks. Native drag and context-menu reordering persist per canonical
attached checkout/PR number, with checkout separate. Before/After and exact Back
are preserved; changed source uses bounded anchors or an explicit error.
Normal/Critical now use ⌥⌘1/⌥⌘2. Nested native splits pass both divider checks.
**269 tests /57 suites**, light/dark renders, check/build/strict signing/resources
pass; built **14:41:15 CDT**. Physical drag/menu/shortcut checks remain unverified;
desktop automation is unavailable. [Contract and acceptance](plans/bookmarks.md).

**Caller identity pills and cycle repair (2026-10-11):** each caller is a
clickable capsule colored from a fixed 12-color palette by a deterministic
method-name/full-file-path hash. Colors persist across branches/relaunches;
light/dark text hierarchy and native navigation remain. Recursive branches now
stop before rendering a repeated callable, checked by semantic identity and
canonical declaration location; distinct same-named functions remain separate.
**263 tests / 55 suites**, three-width light/dark renders, check/build/strict
signing/packaged resources pass; built **13:47:46 CDT**. Retried live automation
still reports missing `@oai/sky`; mouse checks remain unverified.
[Palette and cycle evidence](plans/caller-pills.md).

**Reference caller trees and resizable inspector (2026-10-11):** reference
disclosure traces the containing callable backward through exact SCIP identities
and parsed calls, preserving branches and marking recursion/unknown boundaries.
No depth cutoff; larger trees continue with Trace more callers. Native VSplitView
resizes independently scrolling References and Definition/Outline panes.
**260 tests / 54 suites** pass, including 270-level continuation, caller/Back
navigation and native divider resizing. Three-width light/dark component renders
pass; check/build/strict signing/packaged resources pass, built **13:31:01 CDT**.
Physical UI remains unverified because desktop automation failed to start.
[Contract and evidence](plans/reference-call-trees.md). This supersedes the
2026-10-08 outer scrolling layout below.

**Inspector refinement (2026-10-08):** stronger symbol title and
small section headings, compact top-stacked layout, exact-identity definition
deduplication, stronger snippet contrast and faint appearance-aware section
tints. Native PR758 verifies stacked layout, matching-name deduplication,
reference disclosure/Return/Back; three-width light/dark renders pass.
**253 tests / 52 suites**, check/build/sign/resources pass; built **22:59:05 CDT**.
One preexisting highlight timer test failed initially, then passed alone and in
the unchanged full rerun. Different-target native check remains unverified.
[Inspector contract and evidence](plans/inspector-refinement.md).

**Toolbar and Changes sidebar refinement (2026-10-08):** selected-
value Normal/Critical dropdown, Before/After beside it, menu-only source filters;
tab-like Changes/Files/Search without Browse; clearer filenames/status/counts,
selection, summary spacing and filter-aware footer. Native PR758 verifies layout,
mode/revision/filter controls, tab clicks and keyboard Files→Search. Three-width
light/dark row renders pass. **253 tests / 52 suites**, compile/build/sign/resources
pass; built **17:35:01 CDT**. Separate review app closed; user reader preserved.
[Current task and evidence](plans/sidebar-refinement.md).

**Source breadcrumbs (2026-10-08):** source header
reserves a fixed trailing area for change/collapse controls and compacts paths
from the beginning, retaining nearby directories and enclosing declarations
one at a time as space allows. File/final symbol get priority at tight widths;
full location/declaration jumps remain in the ellipsis menu. Live PR758 now shows
crates/harness-core/src/file/Nomex/admit_call; Before/After/menu and five-width
light/dark renders pass. **253 tests / 52 suites**, compile/build/sign/resources
pass; built **17:02:10 CDT**. User reader preserved; review app closed.
[Layout and validation](plans/source-breadcrumbs.md).

**Reader session restoration (2026-10-08):** normal relaunch reopens the attached
repository and last confirmed PR, resolving fresh metadata. Exit PR remembers
local checkout; CLI/manual choices win, and failed restores retain their saved
PR for retry. Real separate-instance quit/relaunch restored tkos #758 without
arguments; the current user's #758 record is saved for the first upgraded launch.
**253 tests / 52 suites**, check/build/sign/resources pass; built **16:36:48 CDT**.
[Lifecycle and acceptance](plans/session-restoration.md).

**Compact source gutter (2026-10-08):** user steered toolbar work
to narrow the existing 104-point gutter to **72 points** and print only every
fifth canonical line plus the actual caret line. Native draw/fold/scroll tests
pass; live PR758 Go to Line7 / Down to8 confirms sole non-fifth label updates.
Combined gates **246 tests / 51 suites**, build/sign/resources; signed
**16:10:23 CDT**. Source font unchanged; counts defer to tooltips when cramped.
[Rendering contract](plans/source-gutter.md).

**Toolbar grouping (2026-10-08):** native navigation/repository,
labeled PR context with compact refresh and Exit PR inside its menu, and viewing
tools with grouped filter/search actions. Duplicate PR subtitle removed; source
Before/After remains in the breadcrumb row. Native review verified grouping,
menus, filter binding, left-sidebar button/Ctrl-Cmd-S and Exit PR. Detail-scoped
toolbar avoids misplaced sidebar tools/duplicate toggle. Narrow resizing remains
unverified after two native drag errors. Same 246-test/signed gates above.
[Contract and review](plans/toolbar-layout.md).

**Kotlin workspace repair (2026-10-08):** user's real app exposed
a directory-symlink copy/hash failure missed by earlier manual compiler probes.
Directory/internal-file links, dangling external Markdown links and complete
tracked build inputs are repaired. The actual PR758 SemanticIndexService path
passes: **2,088 source documents, 18 references / 4 files**, generated with honest
Partial coverage, cache and cleanup verified. Gates **244 tests / 50 suites**,
compile/build/strict signing/resources; signed **01:10:35 CDT**. No physical UI
check/restart; relaunch and reopen PR758. See PROGRESS.md and
[the Kotlin contract](plans/kotlin-semantic-indexing.md).

**Kotlin semantic support (2026-10-07):** compiler-backed Gradle indexing now
supports AGP9 built-in Kotlin; the managed Kotlin2.4.20-compatible tool is
installed here. Disposable real-input builds, pre/post byte verification,
snapshot-only document publication, UTF-16 adapter defaults on generation/cache/
reuse, and persisted Partial build coverage preserve PR identity. Real PR758
After `addSecrecyTag` resolves to SecrecyCtx.kt:18 with 18 references in 4 files;
broader build emits 2,379 compiler documents with two native setup failures,
honestly Partial. Native-component PR caret/reference/definition/Back tests pass.
Gates **241 tests / 50 suites**, compile/build/strict signing/resources; signed
**18:36:00 PDT**. Physical UI remains unverified; relaunch is required to use
the new registry. [Current contract and exact evidence](plans/kotlin-semantic-indexing.md).

**Context inspector recovery (2026-10-07):** native drag-to-collapse now has a
scene-bound **View > Show Context Inspector / Hide Context Inspector** command
and **⌥⌘I** shortcut. Toolbar labels match the current presentation state;
recovery stays available without a source file. ⌃⌘I remains Reindex. Gates:
**234 tests / 47 suites**, compile/build, strict signing and packaged resources;
signed **17:47:35 PDT**. Physical drag/reopen remains unverified. See
[the current sidebar contract](plans/context-sidebar.md) and the newest
PROGRESS.md entry for validation and the manual drag/reopen checks.

The user confirmed on 2026-10-04 that the latest large-function folding fix works: “yeah you fixed it, you can settle at this point.” The recurring status heartbeat was deleted and must not be recreated unless the user asks. A subsequent request now authorizes the caret-driven Context sidebar described below.

The caret-driven **Context inspector** is implemented by Opus 5.5 and replaces the Outline/Symbol toggle. Its upper region tracks the enclosing declaration and references; its lower region shows the selected semantic definition or the outline. Entries are **one line by default**, with disclosure for signatures, documentation, and source context. The lower heading is **Definition**; “Under Caret” was removed. Selecting references stays compact; Return commits navigation. Source Return/Enter goes to definition, and Cmd-[ restores the exact departure caret even after scrolling. A subtle, steady source caret makes character-level keyboard movement visible. Gates after the caret round passed with **129 tests in 21 suites**. A faint shade under the caret's innermost function or method followed. Its gates pass: **132 tests in 22 suites**, `make check`, signed build, strict codesign, and packaged resource verification. GPT Sol verified the faint shade live in light mode on untouched tkos: correct function boundaries, outside-function clearing, fold collapse/expansion, passive-scroll stability, and readable caret/highlight layering. Dark-mode shading remains unverified; see the newest PROGRESS.md entry. GPT Sol verified the caret live on untouched tkos: arrows update Context without navigation, word selection and sidebar focus hide the caret, pinned tint does not obscure it, and Return/Back still works. The same pass confirmed concise default rows and the Definition heading. Full disclosure and narrow-width acceptance, the README availability-label check, and dark-mode caret appearance remain manual; see [the UI review](plans/context-ui-review.md) for evidence and exact checks. See [the implementation plan](plans/context-sidebar.md) and the newest PROGRESS.md entry. `/Users/tqbf/codebase/tk/tkos` remains read-only. Changes are local and uncommitted.

**Critical Lens (2026-10-04, Fable 5.1):** a `Normal | Critical` source-mode control (toolbar segmented control, View menu ⌘1/⌘2), a draw-time projection that recedes known runtime plumbing (stage one, verified live by GPT Sol; see [Sol's review](plans/critical-lens-ui-review.md)), and now function summaries, a bounded critical frontier with via paths and honest coverage, an automatic Critical section in the Context inspector, an automatic hover popover on callables, and reachable-critical counts in the fold gutter and outline (stages two and three). Call edges come only from parsed call sites resolved to SCIP identities; closures and nested functions own their own sites; unknown callees and closure-owned calls make counts partial, never a proven zero. Gates: `make check`, **161 tests in 32 suites**, signed build (2026-10-04 16:19:59), strict codesign, and packaged resource verification. Sol attempted the final native review, but attachment failed with `-10005: cgWindowNotFound` on both the initial attempt and the single permitted recovery. UI work stopped within the user's tooling limit. Implementation and model/build gates are complete; summaries, hover, and counts remain visually unverified. [Sol's review](plans/critical-lens-ui-review.md) contains the exact manual checks and screenshot requests; the final build is left available. See [the Critical Lens design](plans/critical-lens.md) and the newest PROGRESS.md entry.

**Critical rendering refinement (GPT Sol):** the user superseded the earlier protect-all-syntax behavior. Critical now aggressively dims non-call source and ordinary runtime calls; only actual parsed critical/unknown call-name tokens remain prominent. Unresolved syntactic call names stay visible without invented identities/edges. Alpha is 30% light / 38% dark; no layout/storage/navigation changes. Native same-viewport `app.rs:115–139 execute_future` comparison succeeded; the user independently accepted it (“this is much better”). Existing pins/line tint and concise upper call names/independent lower Definition were observed. Dark mode, new mark toggles, hover navigation and folded-count semantics remain unverified; shared-reader activity ended live work. Gates pass: **163 tests / 32 suites**, check/build/strict codesign/empty-env 8-grammar resources; signed binary **16:53:36**. See [the review](plans/critical-lens-ui-review.md) and [current rendering contract](plans/critical-lens.md). Earlier projection/contrast descriptions are historical and superseded.

**Latest Critical Lens change:** the user removed its sidebar depiction. The sidebar now behaves identically across Normal/Critical: concise declaration/references and Definition/outline, with existing disclosures/navigation. No Critical call/frontier/status section, lower summary or outline density counts remain. Sidebar-only work/state/components are removed; source hover and fold-gutter computation remain. Call-focused rendering, toolbar and marks are preserved. Actual gates: **164 tests / 32 suites**, check/build/strict codesign/empty-env resources (8 grammars), signed **17:05:05**. Live check not attempted to avoid disrupting the user's shared reader. Earlier sidebar feature descriptions above are historical and superseded; see [current contract](plans/critical-lens.md) and [evidence](plans/critical-lens-ui-review.md).

**Hover interaction repair:** navigable popup titles and whole rows are now Buttons instead of passive names with small trailing links. Stable content hosting, native full-popover tracking and a source-to-popup transit region preserve entry/loading. External targets stay unavailable; existing exact-caret navigation/Back is retained. Gated **166 tests / 33 suites**, check/build/strict codesign/resources (8 grammars), signed **17:21:39**. Physical click verification remains unverified: native tooling attached to the old shared reader even after one full-path recovery, so live work stopped. No sidebar lens content restored. See [native review and manual steps](plans/critical-lens-ui-review.md).

**Latest ordinary outline change:** all file callables, including nested functions/methods, appear first sorted largest-to-smallest by signature-to-end line span (source-order ties), with quiet one-line `n L` counts. Non-callables remain in a native hierarchy without duplicate functions. Cache keys include both paths as well as bytes/symbols. Original declaration navigation and Normal/Critical parity remain. Gates **169 tests / 34 suites**, check/build/strict signing/empty-env resources; signed **17:35:04**. Live outline verification remains manual because native attachment selected the user's older reader; no interaction was attempted. The previous hover physical-click limitation remains explicit. See [outline architecture](plans/structural-navigation.md), [handoff](plans/agent-handoff.md) and [review](plans/critical-lens-ui-review.md).

**Pull request review (2026-10-04, Fable 5.1; gated at 184 tests / 39 suites, signed 19:56:31 CDT; UI unverified, Sol acceptance pending):** the toolbar **Pull Request** menu lists the last 25 PRs (open/merged/closed) of the attached repository through read-only `gh`; ⌘P opens one by number (the old ⌘P file-picker alias is gone; ⌘K remains). After is the pinned head SHA checked out into an app-owned worktree; Before is GitHub's merge base, materialized per changed file. A **Changes** sidebar segment, file-tree and outline dots, green/red gutter bars and line washes, a per-file **Before | After** control (⌥⌘B), and ⌥⌘↓/↑ change navigation make up the UI. The After snapshot is indexed with per-strategy exact-bytes reuse (git blob digests, metadata format 3); mixed reused/regenerated runs are Partial; Before is syntax-only and never receives mapped semantics. Design, measured facts, identities, and acceptance cases: [plans/pull-request-review.md](plans/pull-request-review.md).

**PR acceptance repairs (GPT Sol, latest):** full pinned blob hunks prevent rename-path contamination; whole-repository dependency-context digests reject unproven sibling reuse; mixed reuse Partial survives cache reload/refresh; refresh preserves revision options; PR failures have native recovery alerts and file guidance uses Cmd-K. Gates **186 tests / 39 suites**, check/build/strict signing/empty-env resources; signed **20:07:43 CDT**. Real #724/#723/#725 backend probes and actual phone-provisioner After Rust generation (one document, 3,711 valid occurrences), matching reuse and context-change regeneration passed. Native attachment selected the user's older pinned reader; no UI actions/screenshots. Full PR UI/GUI cancellation and previous hover/outline limits remain open. [Acceptance evidence/manual checklist](plans/pull-request-ui-review.md); [current contract](plans/pull-request-review.md). Earlier project-local 15/16 reuse estimate is superseded by conservative repository-context policy.

**Latest PR affordance:** visible **Exit PR** (title and return icon) beside the selector while active/loading, using existing exit/cancel to local checkout, with pending error cleanup. No Git branch switch or misleading main label. Gates **186/39**, check/build/strict signing/env-i resources; signed **20:18:12 CDT**. No native attempt; manual check recorded in [PR UI review](plans/pull-request-ui-review.md).

**Source filters (2026-10-04, Opus 5.5; model/build gates passed; UI unverified, GPT Sol acceptance pending):** two independent, persisted toggles beside the Files filter field and in the View menu. **Hide Tests** (⌃⌘T) hides recognized test files/directories from the Files tree. It also hides syntax-detected test regions inside ordinary source as a fold-union projection: a dimmed header line, a gutter disclosure with a hidden-line count, and a quiet clickable label. Detection covers Rust `cfg(test)`/test attributes (three-valued cfg logic, mid-`impl` helpers), Kotlin annotations/test classes/Kotest, TS/TSX/JS framework calls with binding checks and Vitest in-source blocks, and best-effort Python `TestCase`/pytest. Explicit navigation reveals the region; Back stays exact; hidden declarations leave the outline. **Source Files Only** (⌃⌘O) prunes the tree to code/headers outside artifacts, dependencies and generated output. ⌘K, Search, Changes, Go to Symbol and indexing still cover every file. Gates: **210 tests / 43 suites** (including 3 opt-in tkos probes that skip by default; run separately and passing), check/build/strict codesign/empty-env resources; signed **23:16:01 CDT**. Real tkos probe: app.rs 35–43, 803–833 (834 production visible), 3424–EOF; the whole-repository sweep found no false positives among the non-Rust hits. Design and limits: [plans/source-filters.md](plans/source-filters.md); Sol's acceptance: [plans/source-filters-ui-review.md](plans/source-filters-ui-review.md).

**Source-filter acceptance repairs (latest, GPT Sol):** narrow pytest test_ detection, preserve Vitest production else, refresh label hit identities at unchanged geometry, reject hidden headers inside outer folds. Actual AppKit/detector regressions pass; **213 tests / 43 suites**, check/build/strict signing/env-i resources, signed **23:23:22 CDT**. Two targeted real-tkos probes rerun successfully. Native attachment/recovery selected older #691 reader; no interaction/screenshots, visual acceptance still open. [Review/manual checks](plans/source-filters-ui-review.md), [current contract](plans/source-filters.md).

**Latest source-filter scope fix (2026-10-05, GPT Sol):** PR Changes now shares both SourceFilters options with Files; canonical diffs remain full. Rename/copy retained if either available path passes; deleted uses Before. Compact controls, visible counts/totals and filtered-empty reset; selection/filter changes preserve current reader/revision/history. Gates **216/44**, check/build/strict signing/resources/diff check; signed **2026-10-05 19:00:13 PDT**. No native retry; [scope/review](plans/source-filters-ui-review.md) and [PR contract](plans/pull-request-review.md). Earlier Changes-unfiltered descriptions are superseded.

**Latest PR source affordance (2026-10-06, GPT Sol):** previous/next changed-block icon buttons beside Before/After, shared directional availability with ⌥⌘↑/↓. Skip current hunk, nearest from gaps, no wrap; exact revision/content guards, reachable empty-side EOF anchors, observable genuine-caret updates and exact Back departure. Breadcrumbs scroll without consuming reader height. Gates **220/45**, check/build/sign/resources/diff; signed **14:22:51 PDT**. Native attachment/recovery selected older #753 reader; no interaction/screenshots. [PR contract](plans/pull-request-review.md), [UI/manual evidence](plans/pull-request-ui-review.md).

**Latest PR default visibility (2026-10-06, GPT Sol):** changed function/block folds and ancestors initially open once matching exact-document syntax/hunks are available. Header/attribute/decorator ownership is parsed; sibling closures stay folded. Manual choices (including pending diff and new bulk commands) win; fresh coordinators don't replay old commands. Hide Tests stays hidden; late layout preserves viewport/selection, discards obsolete navigation markers and yields to newer jumps. Gates **227/46**, check/build/strict signing/resources/diff; signed **14:47:45 PDT**. No native launch/attempt; component proof and exact manual PR anchors in [review](plans/pull-request-ui-review.md), [fold contract](plans/structural-navigation.md), [PR contract](plans/pull-request-review.md).

**Latest PR refresh (2026-10-06, GPT Sol):** visible Refresh PR / ⌘R fetches current metadata/head/merge-base while old reader stays usable; Refresh List separate, repository reload outside PR. Same head+base is metadata-only. Changed snapshot prepared atomically with protected worktrees, latest reader (including pending source load), exact-byte/Git-line restoration, proven renames and honest revision/missing fallback. SHA-old trails/data cleared, byte-proven current pins/options retained; failures retry refresh intent, cancellation/stale requests drop. Gates **234/47**, check/build/strict signing/resources/diff; signed **20:52:31 PDT**. No live attempt/remote refresh; [PR contract](plans/pull-request-review.md), [UI/manual evidence](plans/pull-request-ui-review.md).

The app icon now uses the supplied root `RADIO.png`; Make regenerates all macOS sizes when that image or the icon script changes. The icon-stage signed bundle was rebuilt at **16:42:51** (preserved in the subsequent call-focused build) and registered with LaunchServices. Compile, 161 tests/32 suites, signing, packaged resources, and decoded icon variants pass; application source and the final Critical Lens UI acceptance status are unchanged. See [the build guide](plans/build-system.md) and the newest PROGRESS.md entry.

Delivered behavior includes repository opening/recent/drop/CLI launch, Git-aware discovery, read-only TextKit source, ripgrep search, exact history, Tree-sitter structure for eight grammars, structural navigation and folding, fuzzy file lookup, and app-owned SCIP generation/navigation. The current fold gutter is 104 points wide with separate 28-point disclosure, exact hidden-line count, and canonical line-number lanes; the earlier 68-point/faint 2-point meter was superseded. Large-fold membership is binary-searched and glyph/layout invalidation is limited to changed ranges. Ordinary and locked occurrence highlighting coexist with native selection; a function-local Tree-sitter fallback covers parsed occurrences absent from SCIP without becoming a semantic guess.

The fresh checkout/build gate on SHEFFIELD (2026-10-04, macOS 26.5 / Swift 6.3.3) passed `make check`, 97 tests in 16 suites, a signed build, strict code-sign verification, and packaged verification of eight grammars/31 query files. Bundled builds now explicitly select SwiftPM's `swiftbuild` backend, matching the successful Swift 6.4 build on ELSTON; see [the build guide](plans/build-system.md). The user’s earlier acceptance is separate evidence that the reported fold interaction is fixed. See PROGRESS.md and the development history for the exact boundary.

## Maintenance rules

- Keep this file the master index; put deep documentation under `plans/` and update PROGRESS.md after work.
- Read and follow AGENTS.md. Use `swiftui-pro` before and after code decisions, `macos-design` for UI decisions, and `typography-designer` whenever setting type. A documentation-only description of existing behavior does not authorize redesign.
- Preserve canonical UTF-8 byte locations and convert only at boundaries. Do not make semantic navigation guess from spelling.
- Never edit the viewed repository during indexing tests. In particular, do not vendor dependencies into tkos or synthesize shadow manifests to conceal real project failures.
- Do not present old test totals as current. Label every recorded count/timing by its development round and say when no fresh test run was performed.
